# HotTubLog

SwiftUI source for the Hot Tub maintenance log app. This is a code-only drop-in so you can create an Xcode project and add these files.

## Quick start
1. In Xcode, create a new iOS App named `HotTubLog` (SwiftUI).
2. Set the iOS deployment target to 17.0 (SwiftData).
3. Replace the autogenerated source files with the contents of the `HotTubLog/` folder in this repo.
4. Build and run on a simulator or device.

## Notes
- Data is local-only using SwiftData.
- Photos are stored in the app's Documents directory.
- Reminders use local notifications; enable permissions when prompted.
