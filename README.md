# HotTubLog

SwiftUI source for the Hot Tub maintenance log app, including an Xcode project.

## Quick start
1. On macOS, open `HotTubLog.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select your Team under Signing & Capabilities.
3. Build and run on a simulator or device.

## Notes
- Xcode only runs on macOS; Windows/WSL can edit the code but cannot build or run the app.
- Data is local-only using SwiftData.
- Photos are stored in the app's Documents directory.
- Reminders use local notifications; enable permissions when prompted.
